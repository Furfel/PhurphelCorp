## Phurphel Corp.

Another game I created long time ago. Probably the best one.

Build with Eclipse with Android SDK.

Uses GLES 1.0. Loads only triangles from `.obj` files. Everything else is defined in and XML file.

Apparently the emulator or the new Android doesn't support PNG transparency and ETC1 textures :/.
